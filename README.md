# GoForge Project Overview

Welcome to the GoForge project, a React-based web application designed to demonstrate the capabilities and potential of using GPTs in various contexts. This project is structured around several key areas that combine to form a comprehensive, interactive, and user-friendly application. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's structure and its key components.

## Project Structure and Components

The `src` directory is where the majority of the project's source code resides, including various components, utilities, and styles. Here is a brief overview of the main directories and files within this directory:

### Core Files and Directories

- `App.js`: The main React component, serving as the entry point for the user interface and application logic.
- `App.css`: Stylesheet for the `App` component, providing general styling.
- `gpts.json`: Contains configuration data for various GPT models.
- `index.css`: Global stylesheet for the application, setting up basic styling and fonts.
- `index.js`: The main JS entry point for the application, which initiates the React rendering process.

### Components

The `components` directory contains React components that are used throughout the application. Each component is designed to encapsulate a specific piece of functionality or UI element. Here are some of the key components:

- `Components/AnimatedButton.js`: A button with an animation effect.
- `Components/GPTModelDetails.js`: Displays details about a specific GPT model.
- `Components/GPTModels.js`: Lists available GPT models.
- `Components/ThemeSwitchButton.js`: A button to switch the application theme.

### Context

- `Context/ThemeContext.js`: Manages the theme state across the application using React Context.

### Pages

The `pages` directory contains components that represent different pages within the application, providing specific functionalities or information:

- `Pages/CaseStudies.js`: Showcases various case studies.
- `Pages/Demo.js`: A demo page for interacting with GPT models.
- `Pages/Home.js`: The homepage of the application, providing an overview and access to different parts of the application.

### Additional Files

- `reportWebVitals.js` and `setupTests.js`: Used for monitoring performance and setting up tests, respectively.

This structure overview reveals a React-based application structured around showcasing and interacting with GPT models. The modular structure supports clear separation and reuse of functionality, while context provides cross-component state management capabilities. Pages define the primary interaction points for users.
